# kuffix

it's a frame rate limit unlocker of the Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders port for PC, inspired from DSfix.
However, it unlock 30 FPS limit with twice game speed. Yes, it's a failure but I create this repo for archiving purpose.

## Usage

It's an interception DINPUT8.dll that you place in the same folder as the game executable. I tested with the latest version on Jan 18 2021, it could be not work if game update later.
